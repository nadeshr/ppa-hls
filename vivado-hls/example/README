This is an example that works with the LLVM pass in ../llvm_pass. 

We have provided the output of SVF for andersen, flow and flow+context analyses.

It is also possible to execute our analysis without an external result. For each indirect access we select between all global variables. Remove config file in this case.

Otherwise, copy the respective output to pointsTo.Vitis, so that the LLVM pass will pick up to points-to relation that you want. You also need a config file. This file was more for us to invoke the right pointer analysis configuration (SVF). The LLVM pass just check if this file exists. 

The output of the LLVM pass can be seen in the log file.

This example was reported to Xilinx and confirmed as an issue: https://bit.ly/vivado-hls-pointer-bug. We have since fixed it using our own pass.
